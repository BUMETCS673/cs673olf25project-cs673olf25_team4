# BeatMap

BeatMap is a web application that helps travelers and music fans discover live concerts in the cities they plan to visit.  
Instead of relying only on artists you already follow, BeatMap makes it easy to find shows by **location and date**, then adds personalization on top.  

Whether you’re a tourist looking to catch a concert while visiting a new city, or a local searching for new artists and venues, BeatMap makes event discovery simple and fun.

## Why BeatMap?

Other platforms like Bandsintown, Songkick, and Spotify’s “Concerts Near You” mainly focus on alerting you when your favorite artists announce a show.  
BeatMap flips this around: it starts with **where and when you’ll be** and then shows you everything happening there, with optional personalization.  

This makes it especially useful for:
- **Travelers** planning trips  
- **Locals** wanting to explore music nearby  
- **Fans** who enjoy discovering new performers
