# Team 4 - beatmap

This file serves as short introduction of each team member on team 4 (beatmap) as required by Lab 1.



## Michael Laszlo (Security Leader)

My name is Michael Laszlo and I have been a Software Engineer for the past 3 years with a focus

on embedded systems. I have some security experience with the projects I have been a part of at work,

however I am looking forward to getting more experience as a security leader at work so I chose

to be the security leader for team 4. Looking forward to seeing what the group can do with the project!



## Sam Akerman - Team Leader and Configuration Leader

My undergraduate degree is in Telecommunications Engineering, and I also hold an MS in Computer Science. 

I have been working as a Software Engineer for the past seven years at an asset management firm in Boston. 

My professional day-to-day work combines software development, maintenance, and support. 

I’m particularly excited about this project because I see myself as a natural user of such a product, and 

also because one of our goals is to incorporate an AI agent into the backend—a first for me.



## Greg Grimaylo - QA Leader

My name is Greg Grimaylo and I have been a Quality Assurance Automation Engineer for 2 years. My experience in Quality Assurance will help me server as the QA Leader for our group. 

I am looking forward to developing a project from the ground-up, as well as the idea of possible incorporating AI to improve our product. Our project piques my interest since I am very interested in music streaming apps and I often attend concerts featuring my favorite musical artists.



## Ed Cavallero - Design and Implementation Leader

My name is Ed Cavallero, and I have been working as a concert manager for the past two years. 

My undergraduate background is in music and business administration, with a particular focus on music software and production. I believe my background in music composition and production will support me in my role as design and implementation leader for this project. I’m excited about this project because I see real potential for it to be a tool I would personally use to discover and attend events. I’m also eager to integrate and leverage AI as much as possible in my portfolio, and this project is a great step in that direction.



## Zixuan Cheng - Design and Implementation Leader

My name is Zixuan Cheng. I graduated from Beijing University of Civil Engineering and Architecture with a major in Computer Science. I have some project experience, but not much teamwork experience, especially with remote projects. That’s why I’m really excited to join this team, and I hope to learn a lot together with all of you.

I really hope our app will be helpful and make life easier for people. I’m super excited to work with my teammates, and it’s also my first time trying a Python project with front-end and back-end separation.

## Zhehao Liao - Requirement Leader

My name is Zhehao Liao, and I am pursuing a Master's degree in Computer Science at Boston University. My background is in Mathematics and Applied Mathematics, with experience in machine learning.  

I am particularly interested in applying software engineering practices to real-world applications, such as our Beatmap project. I am excited to ensure that our design aligns with user needs and to collaborate with my teammates so that we can deliver a system that is both useful and user-friendly.
